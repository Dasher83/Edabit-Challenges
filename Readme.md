This is a compilation of Katas / and exercises extracted from the following [website](https://edabit.com).
We undertook it as a three member team using C# as a programming language.
Following a mob programming approach, each member was a driver on one exercise for each difficulty level, accompanied by two navigators.
Thus, the goal is to complete 18 exercises overall using a progressively more TDD oriented approach as the difficulty increases.
So far, we completed 13 exercises, 5 to go. 

You may find all the details surrounding the exercises and our answers on the "Exercises" subfolder, ordered from most difficult to least difficult.
